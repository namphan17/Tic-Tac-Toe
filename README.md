# **Tic-Tac-Toe**
---
As all typical TicTacToe games, this one will have the same functions. 
In this game, player one will be the X and will start off the game by placing the X inside in one of the 9 squares, only once. 
The second player will be the O. The second player will place the O after every single turn of the first player.
Once the first player or second player place their X or O in one of the grids, they canâ€™t place it in the same grid again. 
Say X placed in on the corner of the grid, the second player cannot place it there anymore. 
As the players continue to place their objects, the grid will be getting smaller and smaller until all 9 grids are taken. How do you win this game? Ok, the key of this game is to line up the objects in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal way.
